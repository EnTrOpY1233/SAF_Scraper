(NASDAQ: AMTX), a renewable fuels company focused on negative carbon intensity products, reported today that the engineering work completed during the past year by CTCI for the Aemetis Riverbank Carbon Zero sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel plant is on schedule for filing permits and conducting procurement commencing in Q4 2022.\nIn October 2021, Aemetis announced that it had entered into an agreement with engineering and construction firm CTCI Americas to conduct permitting and engineering work for the Carbon Zero renewable jet and diesel plant to be built in Riverbank, California.\u00a0 CTCI Americas is a subsidiary of $2.3 billion revenues CTCI Corp., a global engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm with extensive technology and energy industry project engineering and construction experience in California.\nIn addition to CTCI, the engineering and project management team for the Carbon Zero renewable jet and diesel plant includes ATSI, Inc. of Amherst, NY in the role of Owner\u2019s Engineer to advise Aemetis on technical matters related to the project. ATSI is a firm with 40 years of engineering and project management firm with senior engineers who have extensive experience in the construction and commissioning of oil refineries worldwide, including commissioning of a $10 billion refinery in Asia. ATSI has performed more than five years of owner\u2019s engineer and project management work with Aemetis, including carbon reduction projects at the Keyes ethanol plant and the ongoing Carbon Capture and Underground Sequestration (CCUS) projects in Riverbank and Keyes, CA.\nThe Aemetis Carbon Zero plant is being developed at a 125-acre former U.S. Army munitions production facility. The process design utilizes renewable hydrogen and renewable hydroelectric electricity to hydrotreat renewable oils to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (RD). The Riverbank plant is designed for a capacity of 90 million gallons per year with full flexibility for either 100% SAF or 100% RD production.\n\u201cWith the extensive engineering and construction experience of CTCI and ATSI, we are fortunate to have a team of engineers and construction managers with experience in building renewable fuels plants in California,\u201d said Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis.\u00a0 \u201cThe Aemetis plant process design for the Riverbank plant utilizes renewable oils, renewable hydrogen and renewable power to produce advanced renewable fuels that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. There are a limited number of firms with an ability to execute large scale renewable fuels projects within California\u2019s environmental requirements.\u201d\n\u201cCTCI brings an experienced EPC team of engineers, designers, supply chain, and project management to the Aemetis sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel plant,\u201d stated Patrick Jameson, CEO of CTCI Americas.\u00a0 \u201cWe are currently working on several sustainable and renewable fuel projects including an EPC of a large renewable diesel plant in California.\u201d\n\u201cATSI has worked closely with Aemetis for many years and we are comfortable with the high standards of project execution required to meet their expectations,\u201d said Brian Fojtasek, President of ATSI, Inc. \u201cOur role as the Owner\u2019s Engineer firm on the SAF and RD project enables Aemetis to have an expert independent view of technology, engineering, construction, and project management to improve the speed, cost, and quality of project execution.\u201d\nSustainable aviation fuel has a significant environmental advantage over traditional jet fuel, with up to a 100% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a lifecycle basis when utilizing low carbon energy and feedstocks along with carbon sequestration. SAF is a vital solution in the decarbonization of aviation.\n\nAbout Aemetis\nAemetis has a mission to transform renewable energy with below zero carbon intensity transportation fuels. Aemetis has launched the Carbon Zero production process to decarbonize the transportation sector using today\u2019s infrastructure.\nAemetis Carbon Zero products include zero carbon fuels that can \u201cdrop in\u201d to be used in airplane, truck, and ship fleets. Aemetis low-carbon fuels have substantially reduced carbon intensity compared to standard petroleum fossil-based fuels across their lifecycle.\nHeadquartered in Cupertino, California, Aemetis is a renewable natural gas, renewable fuel and biochemicals company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative technologies that replace petroleum-based products and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u00a0 Founded in 2006, Aemetis has completed Phase 1 and is expanding a California biogas digester network and pipeline system to convert dairy waste gas into Renewable Natural Gas.

As can be seen from the graph below, the supply of expected sustainable airline fuel that would be needed to achieve net zero by 2050 would require a significant increase, which represents a compelling opportunity for developers and financiers.View full image: Expected SAF required for Net Zero 2050 (PDF)Setting targets has been the easier part of a complex equation: large quantities of sustainable airline fuel at reasonable prices is needed, yet sustainable airline fuel is in short supply.In this article, we will highlight why sustainable airline fuel is of growing importance, and we will explore key considerations that industry participants and financiers will need to tackle in various stages (from production through commercial viability) and from various viewpoints (namely, that of airline operators and sustainable airline fuel providers).What is SAF?Sustainable airline fuel (SAF) is airline fuel made from sustainable resources rather than petroleum. It is a \"drop-in fuel\" in that it must be blended with fossil (petroleum-based) jet fuel (FJF)but without the need for new post-production infrastructure or changes in equipment\u2014in most cases, up to a maximum of 50 percent of the \"dropped-in\" fuel can be SAF.

                    "Text body": "We create renewable fuels from renewable agricultural byproducts or waste products.\nAemetis\u2019s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (RD) are created from waste oils/fats and biomass generated from agricultural wastes. Complex technologies work in tandem to transform these various waste resources into higher-value clean fuels.\nAemetis is in the process of developing advanced RD and SAF from oils, fats and tallows available in California. Aemetis is also in the process of developing fuels and energy from woody waste generated with byproducts of agriculture and forest management.\nThe Aemetis facilities are designed with flexibility in mind, with the ability to adjust the outputs to produce either renewable diesel only or a mix of RD and up to 50% SAF, allowing Aemetis to respond to changing market conditions for the two products.\nAemetis has purchased a 125-acre, commercial/industrial site at a former US Army munitions facility in the\n               \n                Central Valley town of Riverbank\n               \n               that will be the site of the SAF/renewable diesel facilities. It will be co-located with a Carbon Capture and Storage facility, allowing Aemetis to reduce atmospheric carbon levels as part of its SAF/renewable diesel production efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. consumes more than 40 billion gallons of diesel on U.S. roadways every year and more than 10 billion gallons of aviation fuel. Petroleum in transportation creates 1,700 Million metric tons of CO2 per year. Diesel and aviation fuel also emit soot, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and other hazardous air pollutants.\nRenewable diesel meets the same standards and quality controls of traditional petroleum diesel. Renewable diesel performs comparably to traditional diesel but contains dramatically lower tailpipe and lifecycle emissions.\nAdditionally, our facilities will produce SAF and renewable diesel at or below the carbon intensity of comparable fuels in the market today. When combined with carbon capture and storage, our facilities permanently remove atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering overall greenhouse gases. Transportation relies heavily on petroleum, and finding nature-based alternatives is one of the most powerful ways to stop greenhouse gas emissions.\nPlanned Start Year\nCarbon Intensity expected\nLow carbon hydroelectric power with onsite substation\nIn off-take agreements with a major airline for fuel purchase\nAgricultural waste that is usually burned in the field\nSupply agreement for orchard waste wood for about $20 per ton\nBiodiesel\nWe create renewable fuels from sustainable vegetable oil and animal fat.\nAemetis\u2019s biodiesel is created from biomass generated from sustainable vegetable oil and animal fat. It is created through a transesterification process, generating a renewable, biodegradable fuel that can be used in many of the same ways as traditional petroleum diesel, including use as a transportation fuel, as heating oil, and as a textile lubricant.\nAemetis owns and operates a 50-million gallon per year integrated fuels and chemical production facility in Kakinada, India, which generates biodiesel, glycerin (a component in the chemicals industry), and edible oils. It is the largest biodiesel manufacturing plant in India. The biodiesel technology was supplied by \u2018DeSmet-Ballestra\u2019 from Italy, known for best-in-class available technology. In October 2008, Aemetis was amongst the first plants to commence biodiesel production in India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia consumes more than 23 billion gallons of diesel annually. Diesel emissions include soot, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and other hazardous air pollutants. Biodiesel burns cleaner, improving overall air quality. Additionally, emissions standards in many countries call for decreased sulfur in petroleum diesel, which decreases the ability of the fuel to lubricate diesel engines. Mixing even a small percentage of biodiesel with traditional diesel restores the lubricity of the fuel, which supports the these emissions standards.\nDisplacing petroleum with locally sources lower carbon feedstocks such as used cooking oils, fats and tallows bolsters the India\u2019s economy, provides jobs, cleans the air and improves health as compared to diesel fuel.\nFacility Start Date\nOf diesel is used in India per year\nOf biodiesel produced and blended in India from sustainable feedstocks\nApril 1, 2024\nMarch 21, 2024\nMarch 5, 2024\nOctober 9, 2023\nOctober 2, 2023\nSeptember 13, 2023\nSeptember 19, 2022\nSeptember 12, 2022\nSeptember 7, 2022\nAugust 22, 2022\nApril 26, 2022\nMarch 25, 2022\nMarch 15, 2022\nSeptember 22, 2021\nSeptember 19, 2021\nJune 16, 2021\nMay 20, 2021\nApril 29, 2021\nApril 22, 2021\nFebruary 4, 2021\nFebruary 1, 2021\nJanuary 27, 2021\nJanuary 22, 2021\nJanuary 15, 2021\n\n\nSign up for Aemetis email updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Aemetis email updates\n\n\n\n20400 Stevens Creek Boulevard, Suite 700\n            \n            Cupertino, CA 95014\n            \n            United States\nPhone: +1 (408) 213-0940\n            \n            Fax: +1 (408) 252-8044\n            \n\n\n              [email\u00a0protected]\n             \n\n\n\n\n              [email\u00a0protected]\nPresentations\n            \n\n\n             Stock Information\n            \n\n\n             SEC Filings\n            \n\n\n             Conference Calls\n            \n\n\n             Governance\n            \n\n\n             Contact Investor Relations\nJoin the Team\n\u00a9 2024 Aemetis, Inc.\n",

                    "Text body": "The start of 2023 has been a challenging time for US sustainable aviation fuel startup Alder Fuels as it undergoes changes following the sudden departure of its founder and CEO Bryan Sherbacow. Following a new multimillion-dollar injection of funding from its existing investors, the company has now reorganised its operations, personnel and partnerships, and is focusing its resources on commercial deployment and certification of its Alder Greencrude (AGC) technology. Industry veteran Sherbacow, who the Alder board said had \u201cengaged in questionable financial transactions that benefited him personally\u201d, has been replaced by Acting CEO Tim Obitts. In positive news for the company, Alder has received a Phase 1 Grant Award of $2 million from the US Department of Energy, its third award, to support the engineering design of the company\u2019s first demonstration-scale plant, which is expected to be located in the US Southeast. Investors in Alder include United Airlines and business aviation fuel and services provider Avfuel, who also have offtake purchase agreements in place for 1.5 billion and 1 billion gallons of SAF respectively over 20 years.In a statement, a bullish Xavier Adser\u00e0, Chairman ofAlder Fuelsand CEO of London-based private equity firm Adequita Capital, commented: \u201cWith multiple DOE grants awarded, strong leadership, multimillion-dollar investments, significant strategic partners and a commercial path forward, Alder\u2019s enormous potential is clear. Once commercialised, Alder\u2019s proprietary technology will play a pivotal role in decarbonising and defossilising critical parts of our economy. The Board and its investors are committed to the company\u2019s success.\u201dThe statement added: \u201cTo our friends and colleagues whose roles were directly affected by this reorganisation of operations at Alder Fuels, we thank you for your commitment to the company. You executed your work diligently, with a belief that our mission is bigger than any one individual. Without doubt, you have made this company and our culture better, and we are grateful for your time with us.\u201dAmong the casualties of the reorganisation is Chief Sustainability Officer Nancy Young, who has now left the company. Young was previously VP Environmental Affairs for trade association Airlines for America (formerly the Air Transport Association of America) for 14 years. During this period, she served on working groups at the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative and at ICAO, as well as on the Board of the aviation industry\u2019s Air Transport Action Group.Sherbacow co-founded AltAir Fuels, a retrofitted refinery in Paramount, California, producing renewable diesel and renewable jet fuel, in 2010 and stayed on as Chief Commercial Officer when the company was taken over by World Energy in 2018. The facility was the world\u2019s first commercial-scale renewable jet fuel plant and began supplying regular deliveries in 2015 to United Airlines.Obitts took up the role of Acting CEO last month, having joined Alder as Chief Legal Officer early last year. He was previously President & CEO of the National Transportation Association, a US trade body made up of over 3,700 companies. \u201cAt Alder, we remain focused on a singular goal: to deliver commercial deployment of our proprietary Alder Greencrude technology,\u201d he said following his appointment.The Alder technology is based on already commercially viable and validated fast pyrolysis in which woody biomass is converted to a green biocrude that can then be co-hydroprocessed with esters and fatty acids (HEFA) within existing refinery infrastructure to produce a sustainable aviation fuel rich in cyclo-paraffins and aromatics. The company says the SAF properties have exceptional energy density, reduced sooting tendency and polymer seal swell, so enabling a 100% blend. Partners involved in developing the technology include Honeywell UOP (another investor in the company), BTG Bioliquids, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Washington State University, RPD Technologies, Boeing and others.\u201cAt Alder and with our partners, our technology team has worked tirelessly to advance AGC production and hydrotreating from the lab to pilot scale using a rigorous \u2018stage gate\u2019 development process,\u201d said Derek Vardon, Chief Technology Officer at Alder. \u201cWe simply would not have been able to advance AGC without the support of these technologists and industry-leading experts.\u201dLast October, Alderselected BTG\u2019sproprietary fast pyrolysis technology for its first AGC processing facility at the so-far undetermined site in the US Southeast. BTG \u00a0develops production plants through its engineering, procurement and construction partner, TechnipEnergies. Fast pyrolysis bio-oil conversion of Alder\u2019s feedstock has been completed at both BTG pilot and demonstration scale plants in the Netherlands, which has been shipped back to Alder\u2019s laboratory and will be used for ASTM certification purposes.As a result of a long-term, exclusive contract signed last September,Envivawill supply up to 750,000 tonnes per year of sustainably sourced woody biomass to Alder\u2019s AGC facility when commercial production starts. Enviva says its feedstock adheres to the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard and the two companies have committed to gaining sustainability certification under the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials standard.Alder is currently pursuing ASTM certification, a critical next step for the company as its technology is not among the seven technology pathways so far approved as a drop-in, alternative jet fuel. \u201cThe preliminary datasets related to fuel properties are encouraging,\u201d a company spokesperson toldGreenAir. \u201cThey suggest we may be able to enter the so-called \u2018Fast Track\u2019 approach to certification, which can take 12-18 months and would be significantly faster than the standard path that can take years. We haven\u2019t received formal approval as yet but we have been in discussions and are hopeful it will come this year. We are confident the technology works.\u201cIt is important to note that even without ASTM certification, AGC can be used to make renewable diesel and marine fuel, as well as green chemicals.\u201dFive of the pathways that have been approved so far under the ASTM D4054 process are required to be blended with petroleum-based jet fuel up to a 50% maximum level, with the other two requiring a maximum 10% level. The blend percentage for each concept that goes through the D4054 Fast Track is currently limited to 10%.An attractive feature of the Alder Greencrude product is that as a result of pyrolysis, it retains aromatics that are necessary for seal swell in jet engines. A major reason for the 50% maximum blend limit in the present approved pathways is that the technologies employed produce SAF with no aromatic content. To achieve a 100% sustainable aviation fuel therefore requires an additional synthetic aromatic kerosene content and so the Alder product with its cyclo-paraffins has a potential distinct advantage over other SAFs, while also avoiding some of the downsides of aromatics, such as the generation of excess particulates.\u201cIn theory, we could make a 100% SAF but we\u2019re not pursuing it yet as ASTM has not finalised how they are going to qualify 100% SAF,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cWe are looking at the Fast Track process and will hopefully get certification within 18 months. Once we have it, we\u2019ll decide on the next level of certification, whether it\u2019s 100% SAF or we look for a higher blending level.\u201dWith discussions still ongoing with states and counties on the exact location for the demonstration-scale plant, the company is not yet ready to disclose when construction will start and does not expect completion within the next two years. The facility will be rated to process 120 dry tonnes per day of forest residuals and produce 3 million gallons per year of liquid hydrocarbon biofuel, of which 2 million gallons will be SAF.\u201cWe are still focused on project development and AGC pilot testing to inform engineering for commercial-scale production. We will have more to share on our revised delivery timeline in the coming months,\u201d he reported. \u201cThe focus, for now, is resolutely on achieving key technical milestones that further de-risk our production process and get us to the next stage of growth.\u201dPhoto: United AirlinesChristopher SurgenorEditorLinkedinTags:Alder FuelsBTG BioliquidsEnvivaHoneywellUnited AirlinesContinue ReadingPreviousVirgin Atlantic targeting November for first transatlantic 100% SAF net zero flightNextLufthansa Group announces \u2018Green Fares\u2019, a new SAF agreement and sharkskin flightsMore News & Features4 min readEuropean airlines call on policymakers to help \u201csupercharge\u201d domestic SAF production27 March 2024Christopher Surgenor5 min readAir New Zealand seeks startup fuel innovators in quest for 20% SAF usage by 203026 March 2024Tony Harrington4 min readBritish Airways in multi-million-pound energy transition to reduce Heathrow ground emissions19 March 2024Christopher Surgenor4 min readHybrid electric flight pioneer Ampaire ground tests Dimensional Energy e-fuel6 March 2024Tony Harrington4 min readSouthwest Airlines launches sustainability investment platform and takes stake in LanzaJet29 February 2024Tony Harrington4 min readIAG signs major 14-year deal with US producer Twelve for 785,000 tonnes of advanced e-SAF28 February 2024Tony Harrington",

(NYSE: EVA), the world\u2019s leading producer of sustainably sourced woody biomass, and Alder Fuels, a clean tech developer and greencrude producer, have signed a contract for the long-term, large-scale supply of woody biomass from Enviva, which sources low-value fiber, such as forest byproducts like tree tops, limbs, and commercial thinnings, to further commercialize the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).Today\u2019s agreement would make Enviva an exclusive supplier of up to 750,000 metric tons per year of sustainably sourced woody biomass to Alder\u2019s first Alder Greencrude (AGC) production facility, soon to be under construction in the southeastern United States. The supply of sustainably sourced woody biomass feedstock by Enviva is expected to commence in 2024, which will meet rigorous sustainability criteria, subject to independent, third-party audits and certifications.Backed by Honeywell UOP, United Ventures, AvFuel, Boeing, U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, AGC can be refined using existing infrastructure into low-carbon to carbon-negative SAF that matches petroleum-based equivalents on specification and performance.Bryan Sherbacow, Alder Fuels\u2019 President & CEO, commented, \u201cDecarbonization of our entire economy is driving massive demand for the next generation of sustainably sourced renewable fuels. The size of the market for our product is equal to the petroleum market it replaces. With AGC technology, the challenge of meeting this demand is no longer industry willpower or commercial interest; it is having ready access to diverse, highly accredited, and sustainably produced sources of biomass. Today\u2019s announcement brings us one step closer towards achieving that aim, while benefiting the communities in which we operate.\u201dThe announcement represents a major milestone in the rapid acceleration and scaling up of low-carbon transportation fuels with the potential to fundamentally change the future of flying and other modes of transport over time. In March 2021,major U.S. airlinescommitted to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which was reinforced by an announcement in October 2021 by theworld\u2019s airlinesandaviation community. Recognizing the scaling up of SAF is critical to meeting such aggressive climate goals, the White House launched the \u201cSAF Grand Challenge,\u201d with goals to have 3 billion gallons of SAF produced in the U.S. by 2030 and augmenting to 35 billion gallons by 2050. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law amplifies the U.S. commitment to SAF by providing tax credits for every gallon of SAF produced based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reduction percentages. Further, the IRA extends and modifies the tax credit for the production of renewable energy from biomass and other technologies.Europe is pursuing similarpolicy initiativessuch as ReFuelEU, with the European Parliament voting in support ofdraft rulesto require SAF to account for at least 85 percent of European Union (EU) aviation fuel by 2050. Similarly, the United Kingdom announced the introduction of aSAF mandate, requiring at least 10 percent of jet fuel to be produced sustainably by 2030.Major U.S. airlines have been seeking opportunities to collaborate with other industries to deliver commercial solutions to sustainable aviation at scale, with such initiatives accelerating over the past two years as they individually, and collectively, committed to becoming carbon neutral. In fact, United Airlines has already committed to purchase 1.5 billion gallons of SAF from Alder Fuels when produced to the airline\u2019s requirements. United Airlines\u2019 commitment represents purchasing more than twice as much SAF as the rest of the world\u2019s airlines combined.\u201cAbundant sustainable biomass conversion to energy-dense, drop-in liquid fuels is essential to accelerating the current global transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d said Thomas Meth, President of Enviva. \u201cThis joint effort between Enviva and Alder Fuels enables sourcing of sustainable wood fiber and industry-leading technology to deliver the feedstock flexibility and commercialization of SAF needed to achieve jet fuel decarbonization at scale.\u201dAll woody biomass feedstock supplied by Enviva to Alder Fuels will continue to adhere to the U.S.\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard, the EU\u2019s Renewable Energy Directive\u2019s requirements, as well as Enviva\u2019s industry-leadingResponsible Sourcing Policy. In addition, Enviva and Alder Fuels have committed to collaborating to gain sustainability certification under the internationally renowned Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials standard. These guidelines and conditions are further supported by Enviva\u2019s industry-leadingTrack & Trace\u00aeprogram that provides detailed, verifiable, and independently audited data about the sustainability of Enviva\u2019s sourcing activities and the journey its feedstocks take from the forest tract to the production plant to customers around the globe.About Alder FuelsAlder Fuels is powering the global clean energy transformation and race to net zero through the conversion of natural biomass into low-carbon to carbon-negative Alder Greencrude (AGC). This greencrude can then be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), other low-carbon fuels, and chemicals using existing global refinery equipment and infrastructure. Bryan Sherbacow, Alder Fuels President & CEO, has a proven record for the development and commercial deployment of novel technology, including the world\u2019s first refinery designed to produce renewable jet and military-grade fuels.

                    "Text body": "Alder Fuels on March 21 released a high-level technical analysis of Alder SAF100, a new 100 percent sustainable replacement for petroleum-based jet fuel that the company is creating by combining hydrocarbons derived from its Alder Greencrude (AGC) platform with smaller volumes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced via a traditional hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process.\nAccording to Alder Fuels, the analysis aims to share key insights and high-level analysis with members of the industry and outline the technical approaches the company is deploying to transition its products from bench-scale and pilot-scale to commercial-scale production.\nAlder Fuels\u2019 technology uses an advance pyrolysis process to convert biomass residues into refinery-ready biobased crude oil. According to the company, the ability to blend AGC-derived hydrocarbons with HEFA-SAF to unlock a 100 percent biogenic finished jet fuel creates several important benefits, including higher fuel density and volumetric energy gains; a lower freezing point, low temperature viscosity and synergistic blending; and cleaner burning fuel.\nWork to evaluate the potential of the hybrid Alder SAF100 production approach was completed in partnership with Washington State University, Honeywell UOP, and the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, according to Alder Fuels.\n\u201cWe are delighted to support Alder\u2019s efforts to commercialize and scale Alder SAF100 production,\u201d said Josh Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, WSU. \u201c WSU has worked with more than a dozen Alder samples and the results are promising. In addition to de-risking the scale up process, a key goal of the prescreening phase is to highlight opportunities for producers to hit their development milestones. Producing, scaling, and qualifying new sustainable fuels requires this iterative and continuous testing approach. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Alder technical team as they accelerate their important mission.\u201d\n\u201cTo meet the SAF Grand Challenge goal of 100 percent SAF deployed throughout the U.S. aviation sector by 2050, we will require not only high production volumes of jet fuel replacements, but also just the right mix of different molecules at scale,\u201d said Zia Abdullah, laboratory program manager for bioenergy, NREL. \u201cTo reach these targets, NREL has been closely collaborating with Alder on the development of their proprietary AGC platform. It is very exciting to observe this dataset, which clearly shows the potential of synergistic blending of HEFA-SAF with majority AGC hydrocarbon streams to produce Alder SAF100. Unlocking 100 percent SAF is the technical foundation for decarbonizing aviation and essential for the success of the 2021 Grand Challenge. We look forward to supporting Alder as they build on this positive milestone.\u201d\nA full copy of the technical analysis, authored by Alder Chief Technology Officer Derek Vardon and Alder Chief Project Officer Bruno Miller, is available on the company\u2019s website.\n\n",

The goal of the technologies is to produce fuel that is a 100% drop-in replacement for petroleum jet fuel.Honeywell will utilize its expertise and proven process of developing sustainable fuels alongside Alder, applying proprietary hydroprocessing design to the process to jointly commercialize the technology. Commercialization is expected by 2025.As part of the agreement, United is committing to purchase 1.5 billion gallons of SAF from Alder when produced to United\u2019s requirements. United\u2019s purchase agreement, which is one and a half times the size of the known purchase commitments of all global airlines combined, makes this the largest publicly announced SAF agreement yet. United\u2019s purchase agreement with Alder surpasses the previous record set by the airline in 2015 through its investment in Fulcrum BioEnergy with its option to purchase up to 900 million gallons of SAF.Since announcing our 100% green commitment in 2020, United has stayed focused on decarbonizing without relying on the use of traditional carbon offsets. Part of that commitment means increasing SAF usage and availability since it\u2019s the fastest way to reduce emissions across our fleet. However, to scale SAF as quickly as necessary, we need to look beyond existing solutions and invest in research and development for new pathways like the one Alder is developing.\u2014United CEO Scott KirbyAs a pioneer of the SAF market with UOP Ecofining technology, our work with United and Alder on this new technology will help transform the industry and support the growth of a zero-carbon economy. This solution will not only advance United\u2019s SAF commitment but can help the aviation industry meet its commitments to decouple increases in carbon emissions from growth in passengers.\u2014Darius Adamczyk, Honeywell chairman and CEOAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. forestry residues and agricultural residues alone could provide enough biomass energy to generate more than 17 billion gallons of jet fuel and displace 75% of US aviation fuel consumption. If the US were broadly to adopt regenerative agricultural practices\u2014which capture more carbon in healthier soil compared to traditional methods\u2014the US could generate an additional seven billion gallons of SAF, which would completely replace the US\u2019 current fossil jet fuel consumption.Prior to founding Alder, CEO Bryan Sherbacow built the world\u2019s first SAF refinery utilizing Honeywell\u2019s technology and subsequently contracted with United, enabling the airline to become the first globally to use SAF in regular operations on a continuous basis. Since then, United has purchased more SAF than any other airline and, with this agreement now, has more than 70% of the airline industry\u2019s publicly announced SAF commitments.Alder\u2019s research is supported by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, the DOE and a partnership with DOE\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), focused on developing technology to process organic waste and sustainable, non-food plant material into carbon-negative transportation fuels.Posted on 10 September 2021 inAviation & Aerospace,Bio-hydrocarbons,Biomass,Fuels,Market Background|Permalink|Comments (1)",

The SAF production unit being built by BSGF is expected to be ready to serve domestic and international aviation industries by the fourth quarter of 2024, featuring an initial daily production capacity of 1 million liters, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from air travel and transport by approximately 80,000 tons carbon dioxide equivalent annually, in line with measures from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and International Air Transport Association (IATA) which has set Net Zero target for the global aviation industry by 2050.\u201d\nWith regards to the important questions many have about sourcing and collection of used cooking oil,\n           \n            Tanawat Linjongsubongkot, Managing Director, Thanachok Oil Light Company Limited, which specializes in the systematic management of used cooking oil in Thailand for over 4 decades,\n           \n           explained that Thanachok collects 98% of used cooking oil from various fast food chains and restaurants in the market, the export food and snack industry, and from the used cooking oil collection network in communities, residential areas etc. covering 77 provinces nationwide, cumulatively collecting about 17 million liters of used cooking oil monthly.\n\u201cSAF production will benefit efforts to raise environmental awareness to prevent repeated use or improper disposal in public areas or in drains and water sources, which has always been the main objective of Thanachok\u2019s social projects. Thanachok and Bangchak Group, on behalf of BSGF, will collaborate to further expand the collection capacity of used cooking oil for the production of SAF.\u201d\nBSGF is also supported by operational biodiesel plant expertise, technology, and sufficient feedstock from BBGI Public Company Limited.\n\u201cSAF has many raw materials, but SAF from used cooking oil benefits the economy, society, and the environment, completely aligned with the BCG Economy Model. This joint venture is part of BBGI\u2019s strategy to achieve the Net Zero goal in 2050.\u201d\n           \n            Kittiphong Limsuwannarot, President and Chief Executive Officer, BBGI Public Company Limited, added.\nMitigating the global warming crisis is not someone\u2019s, but every one\u2019s responsibility. The readiness to produce SAF via BSGF will foster an ecosystem that can address the environmentally responsible demands of air passengers, with a product that not only reduces carbon emissions to the atmosphere, but also systematically manages used cooking oil, benefitting health and the environment, creating a high value fuel with a global demand that makes each journey a sustainable alternative.\n",

The Montana Renewables facility commissioned renewable hydrogen, SAF and feedstock pretreatment systems in early 2023, boosting capacity to 12,000 barrels per day. Current SAF capacity in the range of 2,000 to 4,000 barrels per day, but Calumet is considering a move to what its calls MaxSAF, which would boost total capacity to 18,000 barrels per day of renewables, including 15,000 barrels per day of SAF.\nOperations at the Montana Renewables facility were impacted last year by a crack found in the steam drum of the facility\u2019s hydrogen plant. A replacement drum was installed in November. David Lunin, chief financial officer of Calumet, said repair work was completed during the fourth quarter, along with a turnaround and catalyst change the company pulled forward. The renewable diesel facility was completely shut down in November but was brought back online in early December and has been operating well since, he added. Montana Renewables is now operating a near capacity.\nTodd Borgmann, CEO of Calumet, provided an update on the company\u2019s MaxSAF initiative during the company\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. He said the company has progressed engineering on MaxSAF, interviewed construction partners, and is eagerly awaiting feedback from the U.S. Department of Energy on a pending loan guarantee application. According to Borgmann, the process with the DOE continues to move well and the company is hopeful it will receive confirmatory feedback in the not-too-distant future that will allow it to officially launch the next phase of MaxSAF.\nCalumet\u2019s Montana Renewables segment reported a loss of $25.8 million of adjusted EBITDA during the fourth quarter, compared a $13.1 million loss during the same period of 2022. The company primarily attributed the reduction to reduced throughput and downtime at Montana Renewables due to the previously disclosed steam drum replacement that was completed during the period. The segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $30.2 million for the full year 2023, compared to $75.8 million in 2022.\n",

Company officials discussed current and future operations at Montana Renewables during a fourth quarter earnings call held March 15.\nCalumet in February 2021\u00a0announced plans\u00a0to produce renewable diesel at its petroleum refinery in Great Falls, Montana, by reconfiguring its oversized hydrocracker to process up to 15,000 barrels per day of renewable feedstocks, producing renewable diesel and SAF.\u00a0In November 2022, the company said it was considering plans to boost SAF production at the plant to as high as 230 MMgy.\nCalumet late December 2022 reported the biorefinery had generated a full month of on-spec renewable diesel and had commenced rail shipments of the product. The facility currently has the capacity to produce 6,000 barrels per day. Capacity is expected to increase to 12,000 barrels per day with the commissioning of renewable hydrogen, SAF and feedstock pretreatment systems later this year.\nDuring the March 15 earnings call, Calumet CEO Todd Borgmann said that the company\u2019s renewable diesel unit came online during the final quarter of last year and has ran exceptionally well. Catalyst performance and throughput rates have been as planned as the facility runs up to its hydrogen limit he said. A renewable hydrogen unit developed at the Montana Renewables site began startup on March 4, he said, which will allow the biorefinery to ramp up production to 12,000 barrels per day.\nThe feedstock pretreatment unit under development at the site will be mechanically complete in March and operational in April, according to\u00a0 Borgmann. SAF production is also scheduled to begin in April, he said.\nAccording to Borgmann, initial SAF capacity will be in the range of 2,000 to 4,000 barrels per day. The company is also considering a pivot to what it calls max SAF, which would expand total renewables capacity to 18,000 barrels per day, including 15,000 barrels per day of SAF. Borgmann said Calumet has already purchased the reactor needed to implement the max SAF expansion, ensuring that the company can move quickly if it decides to move forward with the expansion or brings in a partner that wants to progress the project expeditiously.\n\n\n",

As SAF demand continues to grow, we are committed to further expanding our capabilities in the coming 2-3 years, allowing for a substantial increase in production volume.What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a type of fuel that is designed to reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. It is made from sustainable, renewable, low-carbonfeedstocks, such as agricultural byproducts or non-edible natural seed oils, and has lower emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. The use of SAF can help the aviation sector meet its goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to a more sustainable future. Additionally, SAF has similar performance characteristics as conventional jet fuel, making it an attractive alternative for airlines to use.In High DemandThe demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel is increasing as the aviation industry strives to reduce its carbon footprint and meet its sustainability goals. The increasing awareness of the impact of aviation on the environment has led to a growing demand for low-carbon fuels such as SAF. Additionally, various governments, airlines, and organizations have set aggressive targets and initiatives to increase the use of SAF, which is further driving demand.The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global airline trade body, recently published acommitment to fly net zero by 2050study. They estimate the amount ofSAF required to become Net Zero in 2050to be over2.8 MMBD.Renewable SAF ProductionBarrel Per Day (bpd)Million Gallons Per YearComment2023 Initial Run Rate2,00030Oversubscribed, already sold to blue chip off-takerBarrel Per Day (bpd)Million Gallons Per YearComment2023 - 2024 Increase4,00060Exceeds current largest North American producerBarrel Per Day (bpd)Million Gallons Per YearComment2024 Expansion SAF15,000230Max SAF volume after expansion (estimated)100% Renewable, ASTM D-7566 (Into-wing volumes are double the above, after blending)IATA Guidance Material for Sustainable Aviation Fuel ManagementU.S. Department of Energy \u2013 Sustainable Aviation Fuel:\u00a0 Review of Technical PathwaysGeographically AdvantagedMontana Renewables is geographically advantaged as a first mover in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel race.

We were looking for a renewable jet offtake partner. We're pretty pleased with the initiative,\" Borgmann said.\n\"I'd be surprised if our physical barrels fall further than 100 miles from Puget Sound,\" he added.\nPreviously, Calumet created a separate unit called Montana Renewables LLC for the Great Falls, Montana, renewable plant conversion while keeping the conventional Canadian crude refining as part of Calumet Montana Refining LLC.\nMontana RD offtake spoken for\nMontana Renewables also has signed commercial offtake agreements for RD with three parties whose names were also undisclosed, according to Borgmann.\n\"We've agreed to terms on approximately 5,000 barrels a day of renewable supply, which you'll remember is the volume that we'll use during the commissioning period starting in September. We'll start receiving loads late next month to start the fill plan,\" Borgmann said.\n\"That accounts for all of our renewable diesel volume,\" Borgmann said.\nMontana Renewables expects to begin production of renewables in September.\nThe plan is for the refinery to be taken completely offline in August, the end of Montana's asphalt season.\n\"The plan is to be down... in August. We need to de-energize the site, so we're not going to try to run part of it,\" said Bruce Fleming, who is heading up the Montana Renewables unit.\n\"We'll do the splicing or unsplicing, change the catalyst for the renewable feedstock and come back up. So, we'll have production in September,\" he added.\n\"I don't have the oil-to-oil outage. We do have a good amount of tankage relative to our size. So, we're going to leverage inventory build and draw plan as part of that. If you had to stick your thumb in the air, figure a month of lost production,\" Fleming said, referring to the timeline for the plant's outage.\nMontana Renewables is about 80% done with engineering and procurement of renewable fuel feedstock, according to Fleming.\nCalumet is also moving forward toward monetizing the Montana Renewables unit later this year. It hired Lazard as a strategic advisor to determine the best course of action for Montana Renewables.\n\"The renewable diesel value unlock potential remains high, with management further pressing towards a monetization event (e.g., IPO or SPAC, private capital raise),\" wrote Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins in a research note.\nMontana Renewables' Fleming said that the purchase of Renewable Energy Group by Chevron for $3.15 billion announced in February \"pretty well-confirmed our thinking on enterprise value.\"\n\"So we've accelerated our Montana renewables recapitalization,\" he added.\n\n",

Chevron\u2019s advantaged market position would allow it to offtake production from this venture, helping to place sustainable aviation fuel with airline customers,\u201d commented Dr. Patrick Gruber, chief executive officer of Gevo.\nThe proposed investment is subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements with customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval.Further information regarding the letter of intent between Gevo and Chevron U.S.A. can be found in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Gevo with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 9, 2021.\n###\nContacts\nTyler Kruzich, Chevron\n         \n\n         Phone: 925-549-8686\n         \n         Email:tkruzich@chevron.com\nGevo Investor and Media Contact\n         \n\n         Phone: (720) 647-9605\n         \n         Email: IR@gevo.com\nAbout Chevron\nChevron is one of the world\u2019s leading integrated energy companies. We believe affordable, reliable and ever-cleaner energy is essential to achieving a more prosperous and sustainable world. Chevron produces crude oil and natural gas; manufactures transportation fuels, lubricants, petrochemicals and additives; and develops technologies that enhance our business andthe industry. To advance a lower-carbon future, we are focused on cost efficiently lowering our carbon intensity, increasing renewables and offsets in support of our business, and investing in low-carbon technologies that enable commercial solutions. More information about Chevron is available at\n         \n          www.chevron.com\n         \n         .\nAbout Gevo, Inc.\nGevo\u2019s mission is to transform renewable energy and carbon into energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons. These liquid hydrocarbons can be used for drop-in transportation fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel, that when burned have potential to yield net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when measured across the full life cycle of the products. Gevo uses low-carbon renewable resource-based carbohydrates as raw materials, and is in an advanced state of developing renewable electricity and renewable natural gas for use in production processes, resulting in low-carbon fuels with substantially reduced carbon intensity (the level of greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard petroleum fossil-based fuels across their life cycle). Gevo\u2019s products perform as well or better than traditional fossil-based fuels in infrastructure and engines, but with substantially reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to addressing the problems of fuels, Gevo\u2019s technology also enables certain plastics, such as polyester, to be made with more sustainable ingredients. Gevo\u2019s ability to penetrate the growing low-carbon fuels market depends on the price of oil and the value of abating carbon emissions that would otherwise increase greenhouse gas emissions. Gevo believes that its proven, patented technology enabling the use of a variety of low-carbon sustainable feedstocks to produce price-competitive low-carbon products such as gasoline components, jet fuel and diesel fuel yields the potential to generate project and corporate returns that justify the build-out of a multi-billion-dollar business.\nGevo believes that the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model is the best available standard of scientific-based measurement for life cycle inventory or LCI.
