Following a new multimillion-dollar injection of funding from its existing investors, the company has now reorganised its operations, personnel and partnerships, and is focusing its resources on commercial deployment and certification of its Alder Greencrude (AGC) technology. Industry veteran Sherbacow, who the Alder board said had \u201cengaged in questionable financial transactions that benefited him personally\u201d, has been replaced by Acting CEO Tim Obitts. In positive news for the company, Alder has received a Phase 1 Grant Award of $2 million from the US Department of Energy, its third award, to support the engineering design of the company\u2019s first demonstration-scale plant, which is expected to be located in the US Southeast. Investors in Alder include United Airlines and business aviation fuel and services provider Avfuel, who also have offtake purchase agreements in place for 1.5 billion and 1 billion gallons of SAF respectively over 20 years.\nIn a statement, a bullish Xavier Adser\u00e0, Chairman of\nAlder Fuels\nand CEO of London-based private equity firm Adequita Capital, commented: \u201cWith multiple DOE grants awarded, strong leadership, multimillion-dollar investments, significant strategic partners and a commercial path forward, Alder\u2019s enormous potential is clear. Once commercialised, Alder\u2019s proprietary technology will play a pivotal role in decarbonising and defossilising critical parts of our economy. The Board and its investors are committed to the company\u2019s success.\u201d\nThe statement added: \u201cTo our friends and colleagues whose roles were directly affected by this reorganisation of operations at Alder Fuels, we thank you for your commitment to the company. You executed your work diligently, with a belief that our mission is bigger than any one individual. Without doubt, you have made this company and our culture better, and we are grateful for your time with us.\u201d\nAmong the casualties of the reorganisation is Chief Sustainability Officer Nancy Young, who has now left the company. Young was previously VP Environmental Affairs for trade association Airlines for America (formerly the Air Transport Association of America) for 14 years. During this period, she served on working groups at the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative and at ICAO, as well as on the Board of the aviation industry\u2019s Air Transport Action Group.\nSherbacow co-founded AltAir Fuels, a retrofitted refinery in Paramount, California, producing renewable diesel and renewable jet fuel, in 2010 and stayed on as Chief Commercial Officer when the company was taken over by World Energy in 2018. The facility was the world\u2019s first commercial-scale renewable jet fuel plant and began supplying regular deliveries in 2015 to United Airlines.\nObitts took up the role of Acting CEO last month, having joined Alder as Chief Legal Officer early last year. He was previously President & CEO of the National Transportation Association, a US trade body made up of over 3,700 companies. \u201cAt Alder, we remain focused on a singular goal: to deliver commercial deployment of our proprietary Alder Greencrude technology,\u201d he said following his appointment.\nThe Alder technology is based on already commercially viable and validated fast pyrolysis in which woody biomass is converted to a green biocrude that can then be co-hydroprocessed with esters and fatty acids (HEFA) within existing refinery infrastructure to produce a sustainable aviation fuel rich in cyclo-paraffins and aromatics. The company says the SAF properties have exceptional energy density, reduced sooting tendency and polymer seal swell, so enabling a 100% blend. Partners involved in developing the technology include Honeywell UOP (another investor in the company), BTG Bioliquids, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Washington State University, RPD Technologies, Boeing and others.\n\u201cAt Alder and with our partners, our technology team has worked tirelessly to advance AGC production and hydrotreating from the lab to pilot scale using a rigorous \u2018stage gate\u2019 development process,\u201d said Derek Vardon, Chief Technology Officer at Alder. \u201cWe simply would not have been able to advance AGC without the support of these technologists and industry-leading experts.\u201d\nLast October, Alder\nselected BTG\u2019s\nproprietary fast pyrolysis technology for its first AGC processing facility at the so-far undetermined site in the US Southeast. BTG \u00a0develops production plants through its engineering, procurement and construction partner, TechnipEnergies. Fast pyrolysis bio-oil conversion of Alder\u2019s feedstock has been completed at both BTG pilot and demonstration scale plants in the Netherlands, which has been shipped back to Alder\u2019s laboratory and will be used for ASTM certification purposes.\nAs a result of a long-term, exclusive contract signed last September,\nEnviva\nwill supply up to 750,000 tonnes per year of sustainably sourced woody biomass to Alder\u2019s AGC facility when commercial production starts. Enviva says its feedstock adheres to the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard and the two companies have committed to gaining sustainability certification under the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials standard.\nAlder is currently pursuing ASTM certification, a critical next step for the company as its technology is not among the seven technology pathways so far approved as a drop-in, alternative jet fuel. \u201cThe preliminary datasets related to fuel properties are encouraging,\u201d a company spokesperson told\nGreenAir\n. \u201cThey suggest we may be able to enter the so-called \u2018Fast Track\u2019 approach to certification, which can take 12-18 months and would be significantly faster than the standard path that can take years. We haven\u2019t received formal approval as yet but we have been in discussions and are hopeful it will come this year. We are confident the technology works.\n\u201cIt is important to note that even without ASTM certification, AGC can be used to make renewable diesel and marine fuel, as well as green chemicals.\u201d\nFive of the pathways that have been approved so far under the ASTM D4054 process are required to be blended with petroleum-based jet fuel up to a 50% maximum level, with the other two requiring a maximum 10% level. The blend percentage for each concept that goes through the D4054 Fast Track is currently limited to 10%.\nAn attractive feature of the Alder Greencrude product is that as a result of pyrolysis, it retains aromatics that are necessary for seal swell in jet engines. A major reason for the 50% maximum blend limit in the present approved pathways is that the technologies employed produce SAF with no aromatic content. To achieve a 100% sustainable aviation fuel therefore requires an additional synthetic aromatic kerosene content and so the Alder product with its cyclo-paraffins has a potential distinct advantage over other SAFs, while also avoiding some of the downsides of aromatics, such as the generation of excess particulates.\n\u201cIn theory, we could make a 100% SAF but we\u2019re not pursuing it yet as ASTM has not finalised how they are going to qualify 100% SAF,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cWe are looking at the Fast Track process and will hopefully get certification within 18 months. Once we have it, we\u2019ll decide on the next level of certification, whether it\u2019s 100% SAF or we look for a higher blending level.\u201d\nWith discussions still ongoing with states and counties on the exact location for the demonstration-scale plant, the company is not yet ready to disclose when construction will start and does not expect completion within the next two years. The facility will be rated to process 120 dry tonnes per day of forest residuals and produce 3 million gallons per year of liquid hydrocarbon biofuel, of which 2 million gallons will be SAF.\n\u201cWe are still focused on project development and AGC pilot testing to inform engineering for commercial-scale production. We will have more to share on our revised delivery timeline in the coming months,\u201d he reported. \u201cThe focus, for now, is resolutely on achieving key technical milestones that further de-risk our production process and get us to the next stage of growth.\u201d\nPhoto: United Airlines\nChristopher Surgenor\nEditor\nLinkedin\nTags:\nAlder Fuels\nBTG Bioliquids\nEnviva\nHoneywell\nUnited Airlines\nContinue Reading\nPrevious\nVirgin Atlantic targeting November for first transatlantic 100% SAF net zero flight\nNext\nLufthansa Group announces \u2018Green Fares\u2019, a new SAF agreement and sharkskin flights\nMore News & Features\n4 min read\nBritish Airways in multi-million-pound energy transition to reduce Heathrow ground emissions\n19 March 2024\nChristopher Surgenor\n4 min read\nHybrid electric flight pioneer Ampaire ground tests Dimensional Energy e-fuel\n6 March 2024\nTony Harrington\n4 min read\nSouthwest Airlines launches sustainability investment platform and takes stake in LanzaJet\n29 February 2024\nTony Harrington\n4 min read\nIAG signs major 14-year deal with US producer Twelve for 785,000 tonnes of advanced e-SAF\n28 February 2024\nTony Harrington\n4 min read\nCepsa and Apical to invest \u00a0$1.3 billion in Spanish SAF facility, while Repsol gains SAF B&C certification\n27 February 2024\nTony Harrington\n3 min read\nAirbus extends SAF partnership with TotalEnergies and forms sustainable aviation hub in Singapore\n27 February 2024\nTony Harrington\n"

(NYSE: EVA), the world\u2019s leading producer of sustainably sourced woody biomass, and Alder Fuels, a clean tech developer and greencrude producer, have signed a contract for the long-term, large-scale supply of woody biomass from Enviva, which sources low-value fiber, such as forest byproducts like tree tops, limbs, and commercial thinnings, to further commercialize the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).\nToday\u2019s agreement would make Enviva an exclusive supplier of up to 750,000 metric tons per year of sustainably sourced woody biomass to Alder\u2019s first Alder Greencrude (AGC) production facility, soon to be under construction in the southeastern United States. The supply of sustainably sourced woody biomass feedstock by Enviva is expected to commence in 2024, which will meet rigorous sustainability criteria, subject to independent, third-party audits and certifications.\nBacked by Honeywell UOP, United Ventures, AvFuel, Boeing, U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, AGC can be refined using existing infrastructure into low-carbon to carbon-negative SAF that matches petroleum-based equivalents on specification and performance.\nBryan Sherbacow, Alder Fuels\u2019 President & CEO, commented, \u201cDecarbonization of our entire economy is driving massive demand for the next generation of sustainably sourced renewable fuels. The size of the market for our product is equal to the petroleum market it replaces. With AGC technology, the challenge of meeting this demand is no longer industry willpower or commercial interest; it is having ready access to diverse, highly accredited, and sustainably produced sources of biomass. Today\u2019s announcement brings us one step closer towards achieving that aim, while benefiting the communities in which we operate.\u201d\nThe announcement represents a major milestone in the rapid acceleration and scaling up of low-carbon transportation fuels with the potential to fundamentally change the future of flying and other modes of transport over time. In March 2021,\nmajor U.S. airlines\ncommitted to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which was reinforced by an announcement in October 2021 by the\nworld\u2019s airlines\nand\naviation community\n. Recognizing the scaling up of SAF is critical to meeting such aggressive climate goals, the White House launched the \u201cSAF Grand Challenge,\u201d with goals to have 3 billion gallons of SAF produced in the U.S. by 2030 and augmenting to 35 billion gallons by 2050. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law amplifies the U.S. commitment to SAF by providing tax credits for every gallon of SAF produced based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reduction percentages. Further, the IRA extends and modifies the tax credit for the production of renewable energy from biomass and other technologies.\nEurope is pursuing similar\npolicy initiatives\nsuch as ReFuelEU, with the European Parliament voting in support of\ndraft rules\nto require SAF to account for at least 85 percent of European Union (EU) aviation fuel by 2050. Similarly, the United Kingdom announced the introduction of a\nSAF mandate\n, requiring at least 10 percent of jet fuel to be produced sustainably by 2030.\nMajor U.S. airlines have been seeking opportunities to collaborate with other industries to deliver commercial solutions to sustainable aviation at scale, with such initiatives accelerating over the past two years as they individually, and collectively, committed to becoming carbon neutral. In fact, United Airlines has already committed to purchase 1.5 billion gallons of SAF from Alder Fuels when produced to the airline\u2019s requirements. United Airlines\u2019 commitment represents purchasing more than twice as much SAF as the rest of the world\u2019s airlines combined.\n\u201cAbundant sustainable biomass conversion to energy-dense, drop-in liquid fuels is essential to accelerating the current global transition to a low-carbon economy,\u201d said Thomas Meth, President of Enviva. \u201cThis joint effort between Enviva and Alder Fuels enables sourcing of sustainable wood fiber and industry-leading technology to deliver the feedstock flexibility and commercialization of SAF needed to achieve jet fuel decarbonization at scale.\u201d\nAll woody biomass feedstock supplied by Enviva to Alder Fuels will continue to adhere to the U.S.\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Renewable Fuel Standard, the EU\u2019s Renewable Energy Directive\u2019s requirements, as well as Enviva\u2019s industry-leading\nResponsible Sourcing Policy\n. In addition, Enviva and Alder Fuels have committed to collaborating to gain sustainability certification under the internationally renowned Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials standard. These guidelines and conditions are further supported by Enviva\u2019s industry-leading\nTrack & Trace\u00ae\nprogram that provides detailed, verifiable, and independently audited data about the sustainability of Enviva\u2019s sourcing activities and the journey its feedstocks take from the forest tract to the production plant to customers around the globe.\nAbout Alder Fuels\nAlder Fuels is powering the global clean energy transformation and race to net zero through the conversion of natural biomass into low-carbon to carbon-negative Alder Greencrude (AGC). This greencrude can then be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), other low-carbon fuels, and chemicals using existing global refinery equipment and infrastructure. Bryan Sherbacow, Alder Fuels President & CEO, has a proven record for the development and commercial deployment of novel technology, including the world\u2019s first refinery designed to produce renewable jet and military-grade fuels. Alder Fuels is backed by Honeywell UOP, United Ventures, AvFuel, Boeing, the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

This skid, which we are calling Pioneer, has been designed and assembled alongside our partners at NREL.\nPioneer integrates all unit operations of Alder\u2019s proprietary technology into a continuous process, with a production capacity of one barrel per day of ARC. The skid design and execution were informed by hundreds of bench-scale experiments, continuous pilot and scale-up experiments, and process modelling simulations with NREL and Honeywell UOP.\nWhy non-hazardous commissioning matters\nThe first step of commissioning is operating Pioneer with non-hazardous liquid; in this case, water. This step is important because it gives us an opportunity to prove the functionality of all equipment using a non-hazardous fluid. Starting water complex testing processes like this one typically comes with unexpected challenges, and it is best practice to troubleshoot and resolve these issues before introducing additional complexities and costs associated with reactive liquids. It also allows us to learn and prepare for \u201cprime time\u201d as we approach fully autonomous ARC production runs, like a commercial refinery. This is an incredibly exciting time for Alder\u2019s technology team. Many are anxious, including the authors of this post, to press the start button after months of reviewing drawings, acquiring materials, and researching every phase of its development.\nKey short-term milestones for Pioneer\nHere are some of the key areas we will be focused on over the coming weeks as Pioneer starts operating:\nPioneer is equipped with design and safety features that are typically found in a commercial facility, including automation hardware and software that allow personnel to operate the unit from a central control room.\nA detailed process hazard analysis was performed during the initial stages of the project, which informed the design of automatic control schemes and safety shutdowns that allow Pioneer to run unattended \u2013 aside from manual switching of feed and product drums.\nTesting each of these safety features is a key commissioning milestone for the water run, which is expected to be fully completed by mid-May. Commissioning with reactive liquids (e.g., commercial fast pyrolysis oil) will be next.\nAfter Pioneer is fully commissioned, we intend to operate for extended campaigns (more than 500 hours). Our goals for these campaigns include:\nAchieving milestones for integrated continuous operation associated with federally funded grants from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office.\nGenerating data to refine process conditions with fast pyrolysis oil from a wide range of biomass feedstocks, including Miscanthus grass.\nMiscanthus \u2013 produced using regenerative agriculture practices and enabled by a dedicated DOE grant \u2013 can catalyse the production of carbon-negative fuel.\nProducing hundreds of gallons of ARC to further process into Alder SAF100 for further fuel property testing and future flight demonstrations with our partners, like United Airlines and Avfuel.\nPartnership & best-in-class technology development\nThe bench-scale and pilot development work that Alder executed with NREL and UOP over the last 18 months was heavily influenced by the most rigorous public and private standards of technology development. Pioneer\u2019s creation is the embodiment of what it looks like to undergo best-in-class de-risking and development processes in close collaboration with a commercial leader and the national lab ecosystem. We are grateful to both.\n\u201c\nGetting Pioneer off the ground is a critical milestone for Alder\u2019s business\n,\u201d said Tim Obitts, Alder\u2019s CEO. \u201c\nWe want to demonstrate commercial optionality for refiners and how Alder Renewable Crude (ARC) is a powerful platform that can unleash a range of renewable products downstream. Pioneer helps us do just that. The beauty of our technology is its adaptability. Once fully commercialized, ARC can be refined into SAF, low-carbon transportation fuels, and renewable chemicals. Many novel technologies that aim to slow the impact of the climate crisis do not make it to this point, so we are grateful to our private and public supporters, including folks at the national labs. Pioneer will demonstrate how decarbonisation of challenging sectors can quickly become a commercial and technological reality.\u201d\nIn the case of UOP, Pioneer\u2019s design mimics UOP\u2019s design for commercializing the ARC production process. Specifically, the ARC process design underwent the standard UOP New Product Development process for technology commercialization and influenced every step of Pioneer\u2019s creation. The UOP process considers all aspects of the tech-to-market mission, including technical feasibility, engineering scale-up, and deep techno-economic analysis. Stage gate reviews must be completed sequentially at each major phase of development. If the bar for any development phase is not met, the process restarts, so work to meet the requirements to advance can be intense and demands a high degree of rigour and internal review.\n\u201c\nCollaborating with Alder on technology development underlaying Pioneer has been a mutually enriching experience for both NREL and Alder staff\n,\u201d said Zia Abdullah, NREL\u2019s biomass laboratory programme manager.\n\u201cNREL staff have learned what success means and what performance criteria are critically important for industry and technology commercialization, and Alder has been able to leverage the unmatched science, technological, and engineering capabilities of a DOE national laboratory. We anticipate smooth commissioning with water, quickly leading to a successful startup with fast pyrolysis oil. This has been an exciting journey with Alder, and we are looking forward to the billions of gallons of SAF that this technology will eventually produce.\u201d\nNREL\u2019s role in Pioneer\u2019s development has also been essential. We were particularly grateful to have worked with the NREL Design/Build team, which includes talented engineers, technicians, programmers, and safety experts. Alder\u2019s technical team is still growing, so we needed NREL\u2019s expertise for this first-of-a-kind, fully customized, and integrated pilot plant. The NREL Design/Build team provided hands-on support at every step of the process, including 3D design support, safety review, part sourcing, control system programming, and finally construction. Pioneer is located within NREL\u2019s Thermal and Catalytic Process Development Unit and is fully integrated with the national lab\u2019s safety infrastructure.\n\u201cPioneer is the next major step toward making Alder\u2019s technology a commercially viable reality by allowing the team to collect important scale-up data from a commercially relevant continuous process,\u201d\nsaid Braden Peterson, NREL\u2019s engineer lead for the project. \u201c\nNREL\u2019s Design/Build team was critical in bringing Pioneer to fruition through thorough design studies at inception to detailed multidisciplinary engineering analysis, exhaustive process hazard analysis, complete 3D modelling prior to build execution, and finally build execution to ensure the process design was captured and implemented to specification. This pilot process consists of considerable safety implementations for unattended operations and rigorous mass balance closure capabilities to best inform the first commercial-scale implementation. The team is extremely excited and proud to be commissioning the process after thousands of hours of planning and preparations.\u201d\nAs we move into this technology development and commercialization phase, Alder and NREL will employ a joint-staffing model to operate Pioneer, creating the type of knowledge transfer that is imperative in the scale-up phase of a new production process such as this one. It is also an advantage that the skid is co-located down the hall from world-class analytical laboratories, staffed with technicians ready to perform detailed sample analysis and provide real-time operational feedback.\nConclusion\nMoving renewable production from creation, research, and bench-scale samples to fully integrated pilot-scale production is one of the most important milestones a company like ours can reach. Getting Pioneer up and running has taken a monumental effort from a lot of talented and committed people, and we are very excited (and relieved) to formally take this next step towards commercializing ARC production.\nWe are also eager to demonstrate what this powerful technology can really do, and the renewable downstream products it can unlock for refiners. This next phase of our journey is arguably the most important one: showcasing the continuous and independent production of Alder Renewable Crude.\nSubscribe to our free newsletter\nFor more opinions from SAF Investor, subscribe to our email newsletter.\nSubscribe here\nCore topics\nProjects\nTopics\nSkid\nWater\nPlaces\nUS\nPlaces\nAll\nOrganisations\nAlder Fuels\nDepartment of Energy\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory\nPeople\nDr Derek Vardon\nMatt Sherick\nTim Obitts\nZia Abdullah\nSHARE:\nCoupling investment with long-term demand certainty\nMarch 15, 2024\nLignin conversion breakthrough: SAF gets cost-competitive\nFebruary 19, 2024\nSAF gets \u2018strategic\u2019 tag in EU\u2019s plan to cut carbon emissions\nFebruary 14, 2024\nHIA urges UK government to support hydrogen for aviation\nMarch 19, 2024\nNew Energy Blue to expand Texas facility to produce SAF\nMarch 18, 2024\nWorld Energy eyes $2bn DOE loan for Houston plant\nMarch 18, 2024\n"

The goal of the technologies is to produce fuel that is a 100% drop-in replacement for petroleum jet fuel.\nHoneywell will utilize its expertise and proven process of developing sustainable fuels alongside Alder, applying proprietary hydroprocessing design to the process to jointly commercialize the technology. Commercialization is expected by 2025.\nAs part of the agreement, United is committing to purchase 1.5 billion gallons of SAF from Alder when produced to United\u2019s requirements. United\u2019s purchase agreement, which is one and a half times the size of the known purchase commitments of all global airlines combined, makes this the largest publicly announced SAF agreement yet. United\u2019s purchase agreement with Alder surpasses the previous record set by the airline in 2015 through its investment in Fulcrum BioEnergy with its option to purchase up to 900 million gallons of SAF.\nSince announcing our 100% green commitment in 2020, United has stayed focused on decarbonizing without relying on the use of traditional carbon offsets. Part of that commitment means increasing SAF usage and availability since it\u2019s the fastest way to reduce emissions across our fleet. However, to scale SAF as quickly as necessary, we need to look beyond existing solutions and invest in research and development for new pathways like the one Alder is developing.\n\u2014United CEO Scott Kirby\nAs a pioneer of the SAF market with UOP Ecofining technology, our work with United and Alder on this new technology will help transform the industry and support the growth of a zero-carbon economy. This solution will not only advance United\u2019s SAF commitment but can help the aviation industry meet its commitments to decouple increases in carbon emissions from growth in passengers.\n\u2014Darius Adamczyk, Honeywell chairman and CEO\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. forestry residues and agricultural residues alone could provide enough biomass energy to generate more than 17 billion gallons of jet fuel and displace 75% of US aviation fuel consumption. If the US were broadly to adopt regenerative agricultural practices\u2014which capture more carbon in healthier soil compared to traditional methods\u2014the US could generate an additional seven billion gallons of SAF, which would completely replace the US\u2019 current fossil jet fuel consumption.\nPrior to founding Alder, CEO Bryan Sherbacow built the world\u2019s first SAF refinery utilizing Honeywell\u2019s technology and subsequently contracted with United, enabling the airline to become the first globally to use SAF in regular operations on a continuous basis. Since then, United has purchased more SAF than any other airline and, with this agreement now, has more than 70% of the airline industry\u2019s publicly announced SAF commitments.\nAlder\u2019s research is supported by the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, the DOE and a partnership with DOE\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), focused on developing technology to process organic waste and sustainable, non-food plant material into carbon-negative transportation fuels.\nPosted on 10 September 2021 in\nAviation & Aerospace\n,\nBio-hydrocarbons\n,\nBiomass\n,\nFuels\n,\nMarket Background\n|\nPermalink\n|\nComments (1)\n"

We worked through the expected new equipment teething problems at an excellent pace, and we enter the next quarter on track to demonstrate the steady-state earnings power of this business.\n\u2014Todd Borgmann, Calumet CEO\nMontana Renewables enters the third quarter running 12,500 barrels per day (bpd) of renewable feedstock. Approximately 50% of renewable diesel production is currently being sold into Canada; all of the SAF is being delivered to Shell Aviation; and the renewable hydrogen plant capacity was demonstrated.\nFeedstock mix is presently 8,000 bpd untreated and 4,500 bpd of treated safety stock as Montana Renewables rotates from clean to dirty inventory.\nWith these milestones met, we have demonstrated Untreated EBITDA of $1.25 to $1.45 per gallon and confirmed top-tier status given Montana Renewables\u2019 unique advantages of preferred location, better technology and higher margins.\n\u2014Bruce Fleming, CEO Montana Renewables and EVP Corporate Development\nThe planned hydraulic expansion and MaxSAF developments both continue as the company strategically seeks to grow its first-mover position in the rapidly accelerating SAF market.  Funding discussions with the Department of Energy are ongoing.\nThe Great Falls refinery in Montana produces both SAF and RD using Topsoe HydroFlex technology. Topsoe says that the HydroFlex process layout offers lower capital expenditure (CAPEX), and also a lower energy consumption during operation, resulting in a lower Carbon Index (CI). Topsoe\u2019s HydroFlex can be deployed in both grassroots units and revamps for co-processing or stand-alone applications.\nCalumet Specialty Products Partners manufactures, formulates and markets a diversified slate of specialty branded products and renewable fuels to customers across a broad range of consumer-facing and industrial markets.  Calumet is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana and operates twelve facilities throughout North America.\nMontana Renewables is a renewable fuel business located in Great Falls, Montana. In November 2021, Montana Renewables was separated both legally and commercially from Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P., and was designated as an unrestricted subsidiary of Calumet as a part of the separation.\nMontana Renewables\u2019 production facility in Great Falls is strategically located close to major feedstock sources in both the United States and Canada, including the temperate oil seed growing zone along with large farm and ranch operations in Montana and the adjacent states and provinces. This strategic location significantly decreases the carbon emissions as well as transportation costs of both the renewable feedstock to MRL and the renewable fuel to product off-takers.\nThe demand for renewable fuel is the highest in states and/or provinces that have enacted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) that is generally concentrated in the northwest United States and Canada. An additional emissions benefit is that the site\u2019s electrical power is physically sourced from the five hydroelectric dams immediately downstream of Montana Renewables\u2019 location on the upper Missouri River.\nPosted on 28 July 2023 in\nAviation & Aerospace\n,\nFuels\n,\nMarket Background\n|\nPermalink\n|\nComments (0)\n"

So we need to balance the world\u2019s demand for safe and reliable air travel with emissions-reduction goals.\nSo what are we doing about it? Well, for the better part of the past 18 months, we\u2019ve been performing trials to produce\nsustainable aviation fuel\n(SAF) and other biofuels at our Gravenchon refinery in France.\nFollowing these trials, we produced a batch of SAF \u2013 a first in our company\u2019s history \u2013 last month.\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning. There\u2019s plenty more to come.\nBrought to you by existing infrastructure\nUsing our existing infrastructure and experience in traditional refining, we\u2019re uniquely positioned to produce lower-emission fuels (LEFs) at a scale that can support the\nEuropean Union\u2019s ambitions to reduce CO\n2\nemissions\n.\nWe\u2019re targeting to produce more than 3,000 barrels per day of biofuels \u2013 including SAF \u2013 at the Gravenchon facility by 2025. How? By simultaneously treating renewable feedstocks with petroleum feedstocks.\nThis process \u2013 known as co-processing \u2013 results in fuels that contain renewable content, which can help accelerate the energy transition. It also enables us to continue providing the fuel the world needs today\nand\nthe fuel of tomorrow.\nProducing SAF in France is part of our ambition to supply approximately 40,000 barrels per day of LEFs by 2025 and 200,000 barrels per day by 2030.\nclose\nCareers\nNews\nInvestors\nContact us\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nYouTube\nExxonMobil logo\nExxon\nMobil\nEsso\nXTO\nDo not sell my personal information\nPrivacy center\nPrivacy policy\nTerms and conditions\n\u00a9 Copyright 2003-2024 Exxon Mobil Corporation.

                              "Text body": "Fulcrum BioEnergy breakthrough makes first ever synthetic crude oil from landfill\nnews\nby Alasdair Whyte\nJanuary 10, 2023\n0\nPrint this page\nSHARE:\nFulcrum BioEnergy has produced the world\u2019s first synthetic crude oil from landfill waste. The crude oil, which was made at the end of December 2022, \u00a0will now be refined into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).\n\u201cThis accomplishment is a watershed moment for Fulcrum and opens the door for our plans to transform landfill waste around the world into a low-carbon transportation fuel in a way that will have a profound environmental impact,\u201d\nsaid Eric Pryor, Fulcrum\u2019s president and CEO.\n\u201cAfter more than a decade of dedication and perseverance, successfully creating a low-carbon fuel entirely from landfill waste validates the strength of our process and our partners\u2019 unwavering belief in and support for our business model. As we continue to work to address global environmental challenges and advance our development program, we aim to replicate our success at Sierra with cost-efficient net-zero carbon plants nationally and ultimately around the globe.\u201d\nThe December breakthrough took place at its Sierra BioFuels Plant. Fulcrum says that it will be able to scale it cost effectively.\nFulcrum is also investing in the Centerpoint BioFuels Plant in Gary, Indiana, the Trinity Fuels Plant in the Texas Gulf Coast region and the\nNorthPoint project\nin the UK.\n\u201cThis is a significant accomplishment for Fulcrum and the aviation industry,\u201d\nsaid United Airlines Ventures Managing Director Andrew Chang. United Airlines invested $30m in Fulcrum in 2015. \u201c\nUnited has led with bold action to fight climate change, including committing to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets, and investing in more sustainable fuel production than any other airline globally. We look forward to advancing our collaboration with Fulcrum to increase the supply of sustainable aviation fuel.\u201d\nThe company has spent more than 10 years refining the process.\n\u201cFulcrum has successfully demonstrated a groundbreaking technological achievement that will have far-reaching implications for clean energy around the globe. We are proud to not only be an investor but also a strategic partner as we explore bringing Fulcrum\u2019s patented and proprietary waste-to-fuel process to the APAC region together,\u201d\nsaid Dongsoo Kang, head of SK Innovation\u2019s portfolio division.\nFulcrum aims to make 400 million gallons of SAF each year. It has supply agreements with BP, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Marathon Petroleum, Marubeni and World Fuel Services.\n\u201cThis is a tremendous and exciting accomplishment for Fulcrum and is also very important for Cathay to reach its commitment for using 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. As Fulcrum\u2019s first airline investor and fuel offtake partner, we look forward to using SAF produced by Fulcrum very soon. We are confident that this milestone will help open up more SAF production capacity in Asia and around the world,\u201d\nsaid Grace Cheung, Group Head of Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility, Cathay Pacific Airways.\nFulcrum\u2019s Pryor also praised the Inflation Reduction Act which supports SAF.\n\u201cWe applaud the passage of the IRA, which will foster industry growth and innovation to supply SAF. We\u2019re thrilled to contribute to the White House\u2019s Grand Challenge of producing at least three billion gallons of SAF by 2030,\u201d\nsaid Pryor.\nCore topics\nIndustry news\nProjects\nPlaces\nMunicipal waste\nOrganisations\nBP\nCathay Pacific\nFulcrum BioEnergy\nJapan Airlines\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarubeni\nSK Innovation\nUnited Airlines\nUnited Airlines Ventures\nWorld Fuel Services\nPeople\nAndrew Chang\nDongsoo Kang\nEric Pryor\nGrace Cheung\nSHARE:\nNew Energy Blue to expand Texas facility to produce SAF\nMarch 18, 2024\nWorld Energy eyes $2bn DOE loan for Houston plant\nMarch 18, 2024\nJet Zero Australia, Trovio to establish \u2018Book and Claim\u2019 registry\nMarch 18, 2024\nNew Energy Blue to expand Texas facility to produce SAF\nMarch 18, 2024\nWorld Energy eyes $2bn DOE loan for Houston plant\nMarch 18, 2024\nJet Zero Australia, Trovio to establish \u2018Book and Claim\u2019 registry\nMarch 18, 2024\n"

Residents Are Pushing Back\nShare this article\nSix Senate Democrats last month sent a letter to the head of the Internal Revenue Service urging the federal tax agency to prohibit companies that make fuels from plastics and other petroleum products from qualifying for federal tax credits under the\nInflation Reduction Act\n, President Biden\u2019s landmark climate legislation.\nThe move was the latest in a string of bad developments for Fulcrum Bioenergy, the California firm that is seeking to turn Chicago-area trash and plastic waste into \u201csustainable\u201d\u00a0 jet fuel at a\nGary, Indiana, factory\nand construct a similar plant near Houston.\nShortly before the senators came out against tax credits for fuels made from dirty, high-energy processes the plastics industry calls \u201cadvanced recycling,\u201d Fulcrum told the Indiana Finance Authority that it would delay financing its Gary project, called Centerpoint, with $500 million in bonds that the state authority had previously approved, a Finance Authority spokesperson confirmed.\nWord of the delay came just days after Kansas City-based UMB Bank\nposted\na notice on Oct. 17 that Fulcrum had defaulted on $289 million in bonds it used to finance the company\u2019s first trash-to-fuel plant outside Reno, Nevada, called Sierra.\nWe\u2019re hiring!\nPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.\nSee jobs\nThe bond default in Nevada immediately raised questions about Fulcrum\u2019s other announced expansions, including a proposal for a waste-to-fuel plant in Baytown, Texas, a city along the Houston Ship Channel.\nA Fulcrum official denied that the company\u2019s decision to delay financing in Gary had anything to do with its default in Reno. \u201cIt is important to note that Fulcrum\u2019s decision to not move forward with the Centerpoint bonds has no relation to the Sierra bonds,\u201d said Rick Barazza, Fulcrum\u2019s vice president.\nBut environmental advocates who have been\nfighting\nthe Gary proposal locally and with state and federal regulators said it was hard not to suspect a connection.\n\u201cWe think it means they are not producing what they proposed to produce in Nevada, and they are not making money,\u201d said Dorreen Carey, cofounder and president of Gary Advocates for Responsible Development (GARD), a\ncitizens group\nthat has challenged the proposed plant\u2019s air pollution permit from Indiana state regulators and filed Civil Rights Act complaint with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\u201cThey are not able to pay their bond holders and that is never a good business sign,\u201d she said.\nThe company has said it is also working to construct a plant about 25 miles east of Houston in\nBaytown\n, a city that\u2019s also host to ExxonMobil\u2019s sprawling, 3,400-acre Baytown Compex. Fulcrum has set a 2026 date to begin commercial production of fuel there at what it is calling its Trinity Fuels Plant with a goal of making 31 million gallons of \u201cnet-zero carbon jet fuel\u201d each year.\nJennifer Hadayia, executive director of Air Alliance Houston, a clean-air and environmental justice advocacy group, said Fulcrum\u2019s Baytown project\u00a0 is among three trash-to-jet-fuel plants proposed for the Houston area, which she said threaten to add health risks to a region already overburdened by pollution.\n\u201cThis is not something we want in our community,\u201d Hadayia said.\nBarazza did not respond to a request for comment on the status of Fulcrum\u2019s Baytown project.\nThe company is seeking to cash in on the airline industry\u2019s desire to develop \u201csustainable aviation fuel,\u201d often shortened to SAF, to lower greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. Still early in its development phase, SAF can be made with a variety of non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks such as food scraps and yard waste, woody biomass, and fats, greases and oils,\naccording\nto the U.S. Department of Energy.\nBut experts have said using a waste feedstock containing plastic complicates the fuel-making process in a couple of ways. First, plastic is made from a myriad of chemical mixtures, and gasification systems used to process it function the best with a consistent feedstock. And the more plastic in an SAF plant\u2019s feedstock, the lesser the climate benefits because plastic is made from fossil fuels and emits greenhouse gases and other air pollutants when heated to high temperatures.\nMaking fuel out of plastic can also increase cancer risks to one in four over a lifetime of exposure to air pollution at production facilities, according to a February\nreport\nbased on a review of Environmental Protection Agency records by ProPublica and the Guardian. That\u2019s 250,000 times the level deemed \u201cacceptable\u201d by the EPA.\nThe senators\u2019\nletter\n, dated Oct. 27, was sent to Daniel Werfelm, commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. The signatories were Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.)\u00a0 and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\nThey wrote that the language in the IRA is clear that petroleum products do not qualify for the SAF tax incentives because plastics are derived from petroleum products.\n\u201cPlastics are harmful from cradle to grave, including facilities that take plastic-based waste and refine it into chemicals used to make fuel, including aviation fuel,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cThese facilities emit toxic air pollution, and produce chemicals that raise significant concerns from the communities that are exposed. The petrochemical industry is increasing development of such facilities, and is poised to accelerate those efforts in the United States.\u201d\nThey also wrote that it is \u201cimportant\u201d for the IRS to get the implementation of the IRA right, including SAF tax incentives. \u201cThanks to the clean energy investments made in the IRA, we have the opportunity to combat climate chaos through, in part, transitioning to sustainable fuels. However, we can\u2019t get there if the petroleum industry is allowed to obfuscate their products and take advantage of the generous SAF tax incentives available in the IRA,\u201d they wrote.\nChicago-based United Airlines has been among Fulcrum\u2019s financial backers, and uses\nOscar the Grouch\nfrom Sesame Street as the company\u2019s \u201cchief trash officer\u201d as part of a public relations campaign for SAF.\nA United spokesman declined to comment on Fulcrum\u2019s financial situation or the senators\u2019 letter. In a statement, the United spokesman said that Fulcrum was among several SAF companies that the airline has invested in or has purchase agreements with. On its website, United says SAF \u201cis the fastest and most effective way we\u2019re reducing lifecycle emissions across United\u2019s fleet\u201d and that \u201cinvesting in and using more SAF across the entire airline industry will help fly us all toward a lower carbon future.\u201d\nIn all, aviation contributes about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. But when other impacts\u2014including the heat-trapping effects of condensation trails planes paint across the sky\u2014are factored in, aviation accounts for as much as 3.5 percent of warming caused by humans, according to research published last year in the journal Atmospheric Environment.\nThe Fulcrum plant in Nevada was among 11 chemical recycling plants in the United States highlighted by two environmental groups, Beyond Plastics and the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), in an Oct. 31\nreport\nthat described chemical recycling as a failed strategy for tackling a global problem of plastic pollution across its lifecycle. The Fulcrum plant in Nevada is a source of unwanted greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants that contribute to smog and toxic to human health, the group\u2019s report concluded.\nFulcrum\ndescribes\nits technology as \u201cpart of the solution by providing the aviation industry with net-zero carbon, drop-in transportation fuel while reducing the amount of waste being disposed of in our landfills as we utilize this abundant, low-cost resource as feedstock.\u201d\nLast year, Inside Climate News was\nunable\nto verify Fulcrum\u2019s somewhat less ambitious climate claims that the company would make fuel with an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gases compared to traditional aviation fuel made from fossil fuels at its\nNevada\nand\nIndiana\nplants. When asked for the studies the company said were the basis for those claims, Fulcrum declined to release them.\nIn Gary, company officials had assured residents that their Nevada plant was an example of what they could bring to the shores of Lake Michigan, said Carey, the local community activist. \u201cThe bond default notice in Nevada shows that GARD was right all along, and that the company and its technology \u201care not a good investment,\u201d Carey said\nThe Gary project was\nannounced\nin 2018 and construction was originally supposed to have begun in 2020, with completion within two years. The company\u2019s website now predicts a 2026 completion date.\nThe plant is planned for a parcel of former industrial land where abandoned concrete silos rise from the remains of a cement factory that helped build the country\u2019s interstate highway system. Fulcrum has\nproposed\nto construct a gasification plant and refinery to turn 700,000 tons of Chicago-area municipal solid waste\u2014including as much as 30 percent plastic\u2014into 31 million gallons of jet fuel annually.\nThis story is funded by readers like you.\nOur nonprofit newsroom provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising. We rely on donations from readers like you to keep going. Please donate now to support our work.\nDonate Now\nThe company has been working to turn trash into aviation fuel for more than a decade. Its gasification process uses intense heat to turn the trash and plastic into a synthetic gas, before another process turns the gas into synthetic crude oil, which in turn is used to make jet fuel in an on-site refinery. While the plastics industry refers to gasification and a similar technology called pyrolysis as \u201cadvanced\u201d recycling processes, the EPA regulates both as forms of incineration.\nIn addition to the bonds Fulcrum sold for the Nevada project, the company has also already sold $375 million in bonds for the Indiana plant, but has held the proceeds in an escrow account. Barazza said the Indiana bondholders would be repaid, with interest.\n\u201cRegarding the bonds for the Sierra project, Fulcrum is working closely with UMB and the Sierra bondholders to finalize a forbearance agreement to resolve the current matter with UMB,\u201d Barazza said. \u201cFulcrum remains steadfast in its commitment to both the Centerpoint and Sierra projects and their respective bondholders.\u201d\nLast December, members of GARD filed a petition with the Indiana Office of Environmental Adjudication, charging that the air permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management for the Fulcrum Centerpoint plant violates Indiana law because it is based on inadequate information about the company\u2019s feedstock and unsupported emissions calculations. On Nov. 13, GARD formally\nrequested\nthat a judge revoke the permit by filing for a summary judgment.\nCarey also said GARD members are still waiting to hear how EPA will respond to a\ncivil rights complaint\nit filed in 2022. The complaint related to the group\u2019s assertion that the Fulcrum proposal in Gary would impose an oversized pollution on a community largely consisting of people of color with low incomes, less education and high unemployment rates.\nShare this article\nJames Bruggers\nReporter, Southeast\nJames Bruggers covers the U.S. Southeast, part of Inside Climate News\u2019 National Environment Reporting Network.

This investment will give Korea its first HVO and SAF production facility that is scheduled to commence in 2024.\nHVO is a paraffinic biofuel derived from the hydrocracking of vegetable oils (like rapeseeds, palm oil, soybean etc.) and is typically used in the pure or blended form in diesel engines as an alternative for conventional fuels like gasoline, kerosene, diesel. The demand for HVO also referred to as \u201cgreen biodiesel\u201d is reaching new heights owing to its environment-friendly characteristics.\nThe availability of HVO raw materials in the vicinity would strengthen the production base at the Daesan that will be the hub of more projects lined up for the manufacture of thermoplastic polymers like acetonitrile butadiene styrene, absorbent polymer and polyvinyl chloride etc. that have wide applications in the household and industrial goods. On the other hand, Dansuk has planned the commissioning of a second SAF plant by the year 2025 that will have a production capacity of 300 KTPA. The facility will be built at Gusan and will run on the feedstocks coming from the palm oil and acid oils effluents. Baked by the upcoming projects, both the partners aspire to expand their eco-friendly product portfolio that is gaining immense popularity in the country due to stringent environmental laws.\nAs per ChemAnalyst \u2013 \u201cHVO is an expensive fuel, and its consumption has increased exponentially over the years Biodiesel production capacity grew by almost 10% between 2019 and 2021 and the expansions are expected to double in the two-year period whereupon a drop in biodiesel prices can also be expected. The HVO production in South Korea will reduce the country\u2019s dependence on oil imports and will be a key source of revenue generation.\u201d\n"
